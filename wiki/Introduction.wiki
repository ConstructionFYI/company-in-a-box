#summary Welcome to Company-In-A-Box.

= Philosophy =

The idea behind company-in-a-box is simple. You want to start your own small business,
perhaps you have been a one-man-show for a while, and want to know how you can grow.

Company in a box is designed to layout a basic foundation structure for you to build you business upon. It has been designed with many elements common to business and includes most (if not all) of the forms, templates, and instructions you might need for your business


= Concepts =

The basic idea is to download company-in-a-box and install it on your system fileserver (you've setup a fileserver right?)

Additional functionality can be obtained by using a webserver to create your own company portal site.

Company-In-A-Box is 100% free for both commercial and non-commercial, or non profit use. Hopefully it will help you learn about, create, and streamline your business processes
