Welcome to Company-In-A-Box
Version 1.00
===============================

Company-In-A-Box is an "off the shelf" solution to individuals/small business, or people interesting in staring their own business but are unsure
how to this up.

This folder structure has been designed for a small business startup to help
you in your day-to-day businessn needs.

We hope to help give you a head start by designing a simple efficient structure for filing and maintaining your information.

This structure is very generic in nature, and is designed to accomodate
several business models and needs. You will no doubt wish to customize
this structure to fit your particular situation.

Inside each folder you will find a readme.txt file that offers some guidance
on how best to use your structure effectivly.

Let's Begin:
--------------

We start by assuming, that each of the products/services you will be selling
to your clients will come in 1 of 2 flavors.

1) Development Mode:

A project is said to be in "Development Mode", if it is a new product that
is not fully commercialized. For example, the product has no specifications,
bill of materials (bom) and otherwise cannot easily be manufactured by your
company or your subcontractors.

Custom Projects, including one's initiated by your client, would be an example of deveopment projects. Up until the point that all deliverables are completed, and the project can be sucessfully manufactured on a recurring basis.

2) Maintainence Mode:

A projeced is said to be in "Maintainence Mode", when your client is able to
place an order, you can build it according to pre-defined specifications (or take existing product from inventory) and ship it out to the customer. These products/projects still require ongoing client support, and training, as well as possible customization or upgrades to fit a clients particular situation.

Supporting Documents, Product Manuals, Troublehshooting Guides, Worksheets would have been expected to be developed form maintainance projects and  are kept here. Specific Client test plans/procedures and information about client configure

The completion of a Development Project would see all project related information moved from the Development folder to the Arcihve\Production folder. This is also called the 'Production Repository". A copy of the project plan, risk management, specfiications ,and all change request information would be kept here. 

The Production respository is read-only. If items inside here need to be changed. A copy of the structure would be moved into the Maintaince Folder
for editing under a defined Change Request (also known as a Change Order). New sets of project planning, risk, and specifications would then be developed for each change request,then when approved and completed, the change request log is updated and  files are moved back into the Production Repository.


Everything in Produciton Repository is static, however version control turned on so that when new items are copied into it old versions are maintained (sharepoint repositiry)

Similary the change request
